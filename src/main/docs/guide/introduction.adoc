[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply either of `discovery-consul` or `discovery-eureka` features to enable service-discovery in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features discovery-consul
----
====

Service Discovery enables the ability for Microservices to find each other without necessarily knowing the physical location or IP address of associated services.

There are many ways Service Discovery can be implemented, including:

* Manually implement Service Discovery using DNS without requiring a third party tool or component.
* Use a discovery server such as https://github.com/Netflix/eureka[Eureka], https://www.consul.io[Consul] or https://zookeeper.apache.org[ZooKeeper].
* Delegate the work to a container runtime, such as https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes].

With that in mind, Micronaut tries to flexible to support all of these approaches. As of this writing, Micronaut features integrated support for the popular Service Discovery servers:

* Eureka
* Consul

To include Service Discovery in your application simply the first step is to add the `discovery-client` dependency to your application:

dependency:micronaut-discovery-client[groupId=io.micronaut.discovery]

The `discovery-client` dependency provides implementations of the link:{micronautapi}discovery/DiscoveryClient[DiscoveryClient] interface.

The link:{micronautapi}discovery/DiscoveryClient[DiscoveryClient] is fairly simple and provides two main entry points:

* link:{micronautapi}discovery/DiscoveryClient.html#getServiceIds--[DiscoveryClient.getServiceIds()] - Returns all discovered service IDs
* link:{micronautapi}discovery/DiscoveryClient.html#getInstances-java.lang.String-[DiscoveryClient.getInstances(java.lang.String)] - Returns all the link:{micronautapi}discovery/ServiceInstance[ServiceInstance] objects for a given service ID

Both methods return rs:Publisher[] instances since the operation to retrieve service ID information may result in a blocking network call depending on the underlying implementation.

The link:{micronautapi}discovery/DiscoveryClient[DiscoveryClient] implementations all make use of the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#clientAnnotation[Declarative HTTP Client], thus you must also add one of the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#httpClientImplementations[HTTP Client implementations] as an explicit dependency.

To use the implementation based on https://netty.io/[Netty]:

dependency:micronaut-http-client[groupId=io.micronaut]

To use the implementation based on the https://openjdk.org/groups/net/httpclient/intro.html[Java HTTP Client]:

dependency:micronaut-http-client-jdk[groupId=io.micronaut]

If you are using Micronaut's cache module, the default implementation of the `DiscoveryClient` interface is link:{cacheapi}cache/discovery/CachingCompositeDiscoveryClient[CachingCompositeDiscoveryClient] which merges all other `DiscoveryClient` beans into a single bean and provides caching of the results of the methods. The default behaviour is to cache for 30 seconds. This cache can be disabled in application configuration:

.Disabling the Discovery Client Cache
[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  caches:
    discovery-client:
      enabled: false
----

Alternatively you can alter the cache's expiration policy:

.Configuring the Discovery Client Cache
[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  caches:
    discovery-client:
      expire-after-access: 60s
----

See the link:{cacheapi}cache/discovery/DiscoveryClientCacheConfiguration[DiscoveryClientCacheConfiguration] class for available configuration options.
